        - The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224 and originally the Andromeda Nebula,
        is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years from Earth and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way.

        - Betelgeuse is usually the tenth-brightest star in the night sky and, after Rigel,
        the second-brightest in the constellation of Orion. It is a distinctly reddish semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude,
        varying between +0.0 and +1.6, has the widest range displayed by any first-magnitude star.

        - Ceres is the largest object in the main asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
        With a diameter of 940 km, Ceres is both the largest of the asteroids and the only dwarf planet inside Neptune's orbit.
        It is the 25th-largest body in the Solar System within the orbit of Neptune.

        - Deimos is the smaller and outermost of the two natural satellites of Mars, the other being Phobos.
        Deimos has a mean radius of 6.2 km and takes 30.3 hours to orbit Mars. Deimos is 23,460 km from Mars,
        much further than Mars's other moon, Phobos.

        - Fortuna (minor planet designation: 19 Fortuna) is one of the largest main-belt asteroids.
        It has a composition similar to 1 Ceres: a darkly colored surface that is heavily space-weathered with the composition of primitive organic compounds,
        including tholins.

        The ninth-largest object in the Solar System, it is the largest without a substantial atmosphere.
        It has a diameter of 5,268 km, making it 26% larger than the planet Mercury by volume, although it is only 45% as massive.

    - Hyperion, also known as Saturn VII, is a moon of Saturn discovered by William Cranch Bond,
        George Phillips Bond and William Lassell in 1848. It is distinguished by its irregular shape, its chaotic rotation,
        and its unexplained sponge-like appearance. It was the first non-round moon to be discovered.
